the below "Dockerfile" & "entrypoint.sh" are  for launching a fastapi app with uvicorn:
The build is succesful and image jwt-dc.
However on run command "docker run -p 8000:8000 jwt-dc" an error "exec /code/entrypoint.sh: exec format error" is occuring. Please correct the error if any :

 Dockerfile:

FROM python:3.11-slim-buster
WORKDIR /code
COPY ./requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
RUN chmod +x /code/entrypoint.sh
EXPOSE 8000
ENTRYPOINT ["/code/entrypoint.sh"]
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000","--reload"]

Current entrypoint.s:

#!/bin/bash

# Set environment variables
export APP_ENV=production
export APP_PORT=8000

# Start the main application
exec uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $APP_PORT --reload



on testing nginx.conf for a FastAPI /Uvicorn app using nginx -t on ec2/al2 the following errors are seen : 

Errors:
"nginx: [alert] could not open error log file: open() "/var/log/nginx/error.log" failed (13: Permission denied)
2024/01/30 13:20:40 [warn] 26370#26370: the "user" directive makes sense only if the master process runs with super-user privileges, ignored in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf:5
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok

nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test failed"

can you advise on what modification to be made for launching the FastAPI app using nginx/ Uvicorn ?
